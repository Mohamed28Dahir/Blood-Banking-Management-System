## 🏗️ Project Overview

The **Blood Banking Management System (BBMS)** is an advanced web-based solution engineered to modernize traditional blood bank operations. By automating donor registration, inventory tracking, and blood request fulfillment, the system ensures that critical medical resources are managed with surgical precision and accessible when every second counts. 

### 🎯 Core Objectives
*   **Empower Donors**: Providing a seamless platform for individuals to contribute to the global blood supply.
*   **Intelligent Inventory**: Real-time management of blood units with automated stock synchronization.
*   **Operational Excellence**: Streamlining administrative tasks through a centralized governance dashboard.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 👤 User & Donor Experience
*   **Secure Onboarding**: Multi-step registration with role-based access control (Admin vs. User).
*   **Personalized Dashboard**: Track donation history, view impact statistics, and manage profile details.
*   **Donation Intent**: Submit medical history and donation applications with file upload support for medical proof.
*   **Blood Requests**: Effortless submission of emergency blood requests with urgency levels (Low to Critical).
*   **Notification System**: Real-time updates on application status, request approvals, and critical alerts.

### 🛡️ Administrative Command Center
*   **Centralized Oversight**: Manage user accounts, donor applications, and blood requests from a single interface.
*   **Inventory Control**: Granular tracking of blood units across all 8 major blood groups (A±, B±, AB±, O±).
*   **Automated Workflow**: Approval-driven stock updates—approving a donation automatically increments inventory.
*   **Reporting & Analytics**: Insightful data visualizations and activity logs for informed decision-making.
